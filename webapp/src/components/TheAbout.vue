          This website was created to visualize annotations and entities from the Entity
          Inspector extension server. It is built with Vue 3 and Vite, fetching data from
          a REST API and displaying it in a user-friendly manner. This allows you to
          easily view the structure of the entities and their annotations from your
          project.
