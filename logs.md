New Use Case for NKOD: https://data.gov.cz/datov√©-sady

Feature to enhance your experience with NKOD or with smthing like that.

**For Analysts:** You can now easily create models and APIs by utilizing 
our *first* extension. This tool is designed to assist you in writing efficient
code, simplifying your work and increasing productivity.

**For Users:** Instead of navigating through web interfaces and conducting
extensive searches for APIs/models, you can now use our *secondary* extension.
This extension provides valuable suggestions directly in your code, making the
process of creating public models and APIs a breeze.

Furthermore, our extension is highly configurable, allowing users to tailor it
to their specific needs and preferences, thus enhancing the overall user
experience.
